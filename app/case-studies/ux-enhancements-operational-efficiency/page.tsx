        <h2 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">The Challenge</h2>
        <p className="text-lg text-muted-foreground mb-4">
          A mid-sized multinational company faced a recurring issue that was affecting both employee satisfaction and operational efficiency. With teams spread across various countries, employees were struggling with a one-size-fits-all user interface in their Odoo system. Dates, currencies, and formatting were standardized, causing confusion and errors during everyday tasks. For example, employees in Europe were inadvertently using U.S. date formats, leading to scheduling conflicts, while currency misalignment created discrepancies in reports. The lack of personalized locale settings hampered productivity and left employees frustrated.
